<p>Xzone was an experimental game to test a few modifications to
the standard rules of galaxy.  One of the major changes was that
a player bombing a planet of an ememy became the owner of that
planet.  (Though population and industry were reduced to 25% of
their original value).  The idea was that this would speed up
this game.  And it certainly has done so in this game.</p>

<p>The game started with 15 players</p>

<pre>o Squats
o THE_UNSEEN
o Lilliputians
o Crippled
o Terkans
o Kabbalists
o Angels
o House_Fung
o Dragon
o Flonkers
o Olympus
o Sirenes
o Mongoose
o Children_Of_Icarus
o Lab</pre>

<p>Crippled took an early lead by taking out the Squats within the
first 3 turns.  Soon the other players also recognized that the
new rule implied that fighting was the only way to growth and
that being idle meant doom.
</p>
<p>Making the following victims</p>
<pre>o Lab            (turn 7)
o House of Fung  (turn 10)
o Lilliputians   (turn 11)
o Mongoose       (turn 15)
o Flonkers       (turn 18)
o Kabbalists     (turn 20)</pre>


<p>By turn 25, 5 major powers had established themselves</p>
<pre>1 Olympus
2 Crippled
3 THE_UNSEEN
4 Children_Of_Icarus
5 Sirenes</pre>

<p>A major battle between the Sirenes vs Angels, Terkans, and
Dragon.  tipped the balance for the Sirenes, Terkans, and
Dragon, and put the Angels on the top with the big ones.</p>

<p>During the following final turns an economic race developed.
Crippled, being in second place for a long time, was taken out
by the Unseen, and in the final three turns the Angels were
taken out by the Unseen and Olympus (partly as a revenge for
taking out the sirenes, an early ally of the Unseen).</p>
