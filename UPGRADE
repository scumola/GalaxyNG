How to upgrade your existing games:

==== UPGRADE To release-6.4.8 ===============

If you want to allow submission of orders and report
requests using web forms, see NG/web/README.

There is a new Pax Galactica option for game creation.
Details are in the .glx file created using the -template
command.

Graphical maps are turned on by default now.  If you do
not want them, edit NG/Source/Makefile.  The relevant
section is documented near the top of the file.

IMPORTANT: The format of the .glx files has changed.
You may specify the exact coordinates of each homeworld,
if desired.  This has caused a change in the .glx file
format for players.  The ARE has been updated to reflect
this change.  You should update your ARE and any scripts
you use to add players to games.  The new format is:
  start_player
  email someone@somewhere.com
  homeworld 1000 42 75
  end_player

==== UPGRADE To release-6.4.6 ===============

If you want the graphical maps, edit
NG/Source/makefile

cd NG; make; make install
This will create the following files in Games/
run_game.new, are.new, galaxyng.new, procmailrc.new,
and .galaxyngrc.new

Carefully review run_game.new, procmailrc.new and
.galaxyngrc.new, all of which have changed significantly.  

Note that old template files (.glx) will not work with the
new galaxyng unless you change "nation" to "race".

==== UPGRADE To release-6.4.2 ================

Compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.  You
may want to review NG/.galaxyngrc and NG/procmailrc which have
been updated and are better documented.  If you are running a
mirror of the GalaxyNG web site, you should copy the contents
of NG/Doc to your web site and verify that base_url.txt is
still correct.

==== UPGRADE To release-6.4.0 ================

The entire GalaxyNG web site has been rewritten.  You have two
options:

1) Link to GalaxyNG SourceForge.net site (preferred)
   Delete most of your local site and point to files on:
     http://galaxyng.sourceforge.net/

2) Maintain a mirror of the GalaxyNG SourceForge.net site
   Delete most of your local site.  Copy the files in /Doc/
   into your local site.  Edit base_url.txt to set the
   base URL of your site.

==== UPGRADE To release-6.1a =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory. If you
don't want the graphical map then this release is not required as 
there are no other changes.

==== UPGRADE To release-6.1 =================

==== UPGRADE To release-6.0 =================

==== UPGRADE To release-5-1  =================

The turn data files are not compatible!!

=== UPGRADE To release-5-0g  =================

The .galaxyngrc file changed, both the command to zip a file as well
as to mime encode it has been changed.   Best is to do a make install
under some other account and copy the .galaxyngrc file that is created
during the install.


You can also create it by hand, mine looks like this:

# cat $HOME/Games/.galaxyngrc

sendmail {/usr/sbin/sendmail -t }
GMemail gumpu@localhost
encode {/usr/bin/mmencode }
compress { /usr/bin/zip }
savereportcopy



==== UPGRADE To release-5-0  =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-4a =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-4 =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-3a =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-3 =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-2 =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE To release-4-1 =================

Just compile galaxyng and copy it to your Games/ directory.

==== UPGRADE TO release-4-0 =================

**** FILES THAT ARE OBSOLETE ****

The following files can be removed:
o Games/mail_report           ; The engine directly sends the reports.
o Games/check_orders          ; Orders are read from stdin.
o Games/send_<game name>.sh   ; The engine directly sends the reports.


**** FILES THAT CHANGED ****

You will have to edit the following files, or use the copy
created my "make install"

o .procmailrc
  The rule for auto checking of orders changed from

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Order
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/check_orders

  to

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Order
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -check

  A special line is now needed for "report copy" requests

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Report
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -check

  If you want to allow message relaying between players add,

    :0 rw :turno
    * ^Subject:.*Relay
    |/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s /home/galaxy/Games/galaxyng -relay

  Best is to copy these lines from the procmailrci.new file generated
  by "make install", you might also want to add the additonal rules
  to prevent mail loops.

  You probably also want to update your global.bulletin,
  and example can be found in the Doc/ directory.
  
o Games/run_game

  Now takes an optional additional parameter to specify what turn
  is to be run.  You can copy the run_game.new file generated
  by "make install" over your old run_game file.


***** NEW FILES ********

o Games/.galaxyngrc

  This file is essential, games will not run without it.
  It should contains atleast the following two parameters:

    sendmail {/usr/sbin/sendmail -t }    ; the correct path to sendmail
    GMemail you@youraddress              ; your email address
 
  If you allow compressed reports add:

    mutt /usr/local/bin/mutt             ; this is optional
    encode {/usr/bin/uuencode test }
    compress { /bin/gzip  -c }

  "make install" will create a one for you.


Please also read the server manual.
