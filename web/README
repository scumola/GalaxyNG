There are a few things that you need to do in order to get the web
interface working correctly.

Your web server needs to be configured to process .php files with PHP (most web servers have this turned on already).

You need to change the path to your galaxyng directory in the file "env.php" -- e.g. /home/NineLives/Games

Your web server needs read permissions for this file for each game:
	$GALAXYNGHOME/data/<gamename>/next_turn

Your web server needs read/write permissions for this directory and all its subdirectories:
	$GALAXYNGHOME/orders

Your web server needs read/write permissions for this file:
	$GALAXYNGHOME/log/orders_processed.txt
	
If you have full logging turned on, your web server might need read/write permissions for these directory and all their subdirectories:
	$GALAXYNGHOME/statistics
	$GALAXYNGHOME/forecasts
