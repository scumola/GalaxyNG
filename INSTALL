See also the installation information in the Server Manual
at http://galaxyng.sourceforge.net/server.php .

WEB SITE
----------------------------------------

You have two options:

1) Link to GalaxyNG SourceForge.net site (preferred)
     Point to files on: http://galaxyng.sourceforge.net/

2) Maintain a mirror of the GalaxyNG SourceForge.net site
     Copy the files in /Doc/ into your local site and 
     change /Doc/base_url.txt to the base URL of your site.
     (THIS OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED)

GRAPHICAL MAP
----------------------------------------

To disable the the galaxy map graphic option, edit Source/makefile and
follow the directions there.

If you want graphical maps, you will also need to have installed
libgd.a (http://www.boutell.com/gd/), libpng, libz, libjpeg, and
libfreetype (these dependencies are explained on the libgd page.)

This option uses the GD library, see COPYING_GD for details.
This option also uses a free truetype font from Larabie Fonts
(http://larabiefonts.com).

Note that the graphical map is a beta product.  For assistance, contact:

SERVER INSTALL
----------------------------------------

To install the GalaxyNG server use:

  make
  make install

or just

  make install

The install script will create all files necessary to run a game on
your machine. All files will be installed in the directory
$HOME/Games.

The installer will ask you for your email address. It might also ask
you for the location of the sendmail command if it can not find it.

If you want to enable web score lists, make sure you have a
$(HOME)/public_html or $(HOME)/www directory before you start
installing. (Or edit Games/run_game afterwards.)

Much more information can be found in the server manual.  Visit
  http://galaxyng.sourceforge.net/server.php
or review NG/Doc/server.php.

After installation you might want to:

(1) edit and copy the procmailrc file to enable automatic
    checking of orders; Copy it to $(HOME)/.procmailrc,
(2) edit the games.crontab file and run crontab to enable automatic 
    running of games
